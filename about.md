# Haste

Sharing code is a good thing, and it should be _really_ easy to do it.
Tortoise Community is hosting this modified open-source haste-server for everyone to use.
A lot of times you want to show something you're seeing - and that's where we
use pastebins.

Haste is the prettiest, easiest to use pastebin ever made.
It will auto format text color based on detected type (basic text, markdown, coding language etc)

## Basic Usage

Type what you want me to see, click "Save", and then copy the URL.
Send that URL to someone and they'll see what you see.

To make a new entry, click "New" (or type 'control + n')

## Duration

Pastes will stay for 30 days from their last view. 
They may be removed earlier and without notice.

## Privacy

While the contents of hastebin.com are not directly crawled by any search robot
that obeys "robots.txt", there should be no great expectation of privacy.
Post things at your own risk.
We are not responsible for any loss of data or removed pastes.

## Open Source

Haste can easily be installed behind your network, and it's all open source!
